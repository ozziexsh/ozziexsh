👋 Hey, I'm Oz. I've spent the past half decade both working on teams as a full stack developer and in leadership positions. My last role was as Director of Technology at a great company called SafetyTek, but as of right now I'm currently taking some time off to work on [TravoShare](https://travoshare.com) and explore other projects.

A bit about me:

- 🧑‍💻 My favorite things to work on are tools and services for other developers (DX 🖤)
- ✍️ I like to share my thoughts on different topics over at [ozzie.sh](https://ozzie.sh)
- 🎓 I'm self taught
- 🖤 My stack of choice is Laravel + Next.js (checkout [Nextstream](https://github.com/ozziexsh/nextstream-cli))
- 💡 I value communication, transparency, and accountability
